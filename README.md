## Cleaning Datasets
For this step, special characters, stopwords and words of length one were removed.

* The special characters were removed with regular expressions.
* The stopwords were removed with the Tokenizer and StopWordsRemover libraries from Spark ML.
* The words of length one were also removed with regular expressions.

A Dataframe was created with an id column and the title and content columns already clean.
